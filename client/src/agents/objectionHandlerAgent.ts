Rather than focusing solely on the price, let's look at the ROI. Our customers typically see a 3.5x return within the first year through:

1. 32% increase in sales productivity
2. 28% higher lead conversion rates
3. 5+ hours saved per rep per week

Would it be helpful if I shared a specific case study from your industry showing the exact ROI breakdown?`;

What we've found is that delaying implementation often costs more in missed opportunities than the time investment itself. Our onboarding team can have you up and running in just 2 weeks with minimal time commitment from your team.

Would it make sense to discuss a phased implementation approach that works with your current priorities?`;

What we've found when working with companies like ${company} who switched from similar solutions is that our AI-powered features provided capabilities they didn't even know they were missing. Specifically, our customers report:

1. 42% more accurate sales forecasting
2. 3x faster lead qualification
3. 28% higher close rates

Would it be valuable to see a side-by-side comparison of how we differ from your current solution?`;

Based on what you've shared about your current processes, I believe you could benefit most from:

1. Automated lead enrichment, saving your team hours of manual research
2. AI-powered deal insights that identify risks before deals stall
3. Integrated communication tools that keep everything in one place

Would it be helpful if I showed you specifically how these features address the challenges you mentioned around [specific challenge]?`;
